                God bless Daniel McKinnon. After three proposal attempts all foiled by Tori,
                Daniel proposed on the eve of a self imposed deadline. After a stressful day spent moving Tori into their new apartment
                in Mountain View, CA Tori locked them out just after the apartment office closed.
